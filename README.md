# Todo App

This is a simple web application built with React and Material-UI that allows users to manage their todo list. The app features a data grid that displays the user's todos, which can be sorted by different columns such as priority and due date. Users can also filter the data grid by typing in a search box.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, first clone this repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git

Next, navigate to the root folder and install the required dependencies:
$ cd todo-app
$ npm install

Finally, start the development server:
-$ npm start
-The app should now be available at http://localhost:3000/.

### Usage

Adding a Todo
To add a new todo, click on the "Add Todo" button located at the top of the page. This will open up a form where you can enter the title, description, priority, and due date of the new todo. Once you have entered all the required information, click on the "Add" button to add the new todo to the list.

### Editing a Todo

To edit an existing todo, click on the edit button located on the right side of the todo row. This will open up the same form used to add a new todo, but with the fields pre-populated with the current values of the todo. Make any changes you wish to the fields and click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

### Removing a Todo

To remove a todo from the list, click on the delete button located on the right side of the todo row. This will immediately remove the todo from the list.

### Sorting the List

To sort the todo list, click on the column header of the column you wish to sort by. For example, to sort by priority, click on the "Priority" column header. The list will be sorted in ascending order by default, and clicking on the header again will toggle between ascending and descending order.

### Filtering the List

To filter the todo list, type in the search box located at the top of the page. The list will update dynamically as you type, showing only the todos whose title or description contains the search term.
